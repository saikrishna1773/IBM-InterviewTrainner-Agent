üìù Project Description
This project is an AI-powered Interview Trainer agent designed to prepare users for job interviews. Built using IBM watsonx, this agent leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze a user's resume and target job role. It then generates tailored technical and behavioral questions, provides model answers, and offers actionable tips to help users build confidence and succeed in competitive hiring environments.

‚ú® Key Features
Personalized Question Generation: Creates interview questions tailored to the user's specific resume and the job they are applying for.

Dynamic Web Search: Uses built-in search tools to retrieve current, real-world interview questions and industry expectations.

RAG-Powered Analysis: Ingests and analyzes uploaded documents (like a resume) to provide highly relevant and personalized feedback.

Comprehensive Practice: Supports practice for technical questions, behavioral questions (using methods like STAR), and situational scenarios.

Coaching and Feedback: Provides model answers and actionable tips to help users improve their responses.
